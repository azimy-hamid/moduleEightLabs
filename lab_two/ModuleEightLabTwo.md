# ModuleEightLabTwo

## Overview

ModuleEightLabTwo is a simple blogging application that allows users to create accounts, write posts, and interact with posts through likes and comments. This application uses MongoDB for data storage, Mongoose for object modeling, and Express.js for handling server-side logic.

More Importantly, it only creates the db collections and let's user create users posts comments and likes through a very simple api. This API is not intended to serve as a full-fledged solution, rather,it's just there to make checking this lab easy.

There is no frontend created for this as it wasn't a requirement for the lab.
This lab required the db models to be implemented using mongodb, and and api also wasn't a requirment it's implemented for easy checking.
